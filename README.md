# React To-Do

React To-Do is a web application created to make it easier to keep track of your tasks.

## Setup

Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies, then you can run ```npm start``` to run it in localhost. If you are fine using the hosted version, take a look at the usage section below.

## Usage

The website is currently available in [Github Pages](https://john-sandmann.github.io/React-To-Do/), and to use it you must follow these instructions:

* First you add your task in the first input.
* Then you select if the task is urgent, medium or not urgent. 
* After that, you need to select a deadline for the task (this is optional, but if you don't add it, it will not appear in the calendar).

And that's it! The task will apear in the list and also in the calendar.

After you've completed the task, you can click in the X icon to remove it.
